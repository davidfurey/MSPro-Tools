This is a collection of tools for users of the MobileSheetsPro, the
Android Music Reader.

WARNING: THIS IS 'WORK IN PROGRESS' AND 'WORKS FOR ME'. I CANNOT GIVE
ANY GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL WORK FOR YOU.

Requirements:

 * A system with a command line tool, e.g. Linux Shell, Windows
   Command.
 * Perl 5.10 or newer.
 * Perl modules for DBI, SQLite, PDF::API2.
 * Experience with running command line tools (yes, really).

Tools:

Note: All tools support a --help command line option for more
information.

msb_unpack.pl

This tool unpacks a MSPro backup set into the current directory.

Usage:

  Copy the backup set from the tablet onto the PC.

  perl script/msb_unpack.pl MobileSheetsProBackup.msb

  (Note: You may need to adjust the path to perl, the script and the
  backup set if they are not accessible from the current directory.)

  The contents of the backup set will be extracted. All files will be
  extracted into the current directory, folder information will not be
  included. 


flatten.pl

This tool processes an unpacked MSPRo backup set and creates PDF files
that include the MSPro annotations.

Usage:

  Unpack the backup set into the current directory.

  perl script/flatten.pl

  (Note: You may need to adjust the path to perl and the script if
  they are not accessible from the current directory.)

  PDF documents are created for each file that has annotations. For
  PDF sources the original document is included, so the new PDF
  document contains the original plus the annotations. For other
  source files, the PDF document will contain empty pages containing
  the annotations.

  Supported annotations:

  - drawing annotations (line, rectangle, circle, free)
  - highlight annotations (line, rectangle, circle, free)
  - text annotations, but no fancy font stuff

get_meta.pl

This program will retrieve the metadata for all songs from the
MobileSheetsPro database and write it out in JSON format.

Usage

  perl script/get_meta.pl

  (Note: You may need to adjust the path to perl and the script if
  they are not accessible from the current directory.)

  The output will be similar to

       {
	  "title"       : "13. The Old Triangle"
	  "sorttitle"   : "013 The Old Triangle",
	  "artists"     : [ "Luke Kelly & the Dubliners" ],
	  "collections" : [ "HowsaGoin!" ],
	  "tempo"       : [ 92 ],
	  "keys"        : [ "C" ],
	  "signatures"  : [ "3/4" ],
	  "paths"       : [
	     {
		"path" : "/storage/sdcard1/Music/013_The_Old_Triangle.pdf"
		"type" : "PDF",
		"source" : "Sheet Music",
	     }
	  ],
       },
